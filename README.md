# Drawing-Website
A drawing website using HTML, CSS, jQuery UI, HTML5 Canvas. In this, the user can draw by holding the mouse key and moving the mouse inside the canvas. We have several inputs. We have color input where the user can pick any color they want and if we click on the other button we can choose further more colors. Also we have another input which will be controlling the width of the line. Then at the bottom, there are few buttons. First one is erase button which is a toggle button so if you click on it you are going to go from drawing mode to the erase mode and if you click on it again then you are going back to the drawing mode. Also there is a save button so if we click on it, your work will be saved in the local storage. So if we load the website again then we can start exactly from where we left and finally there is a reset button. if you click on it the canvas is going to be reset to a blank canvas.
